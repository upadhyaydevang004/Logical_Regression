# Logistic Regression

**Implementation of a machine learning algorithm**

This is a python code of an implementation of logical regression. 

Using a particular dataset which contains training data, validation data and testing data the following tasks are carried out:

1) Get the optimal degree (hyperparamter)
2) Get the training and testing error based on the optimal degree.
3) Plot a graph of the given dataset using the new hyperparameter.
